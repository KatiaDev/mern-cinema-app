## Project Setup
- [ ] Fork and clone the repository.

## STEPS to follow:

### 1. First things first: Planning
Take time to plan out what data you will need, which structures will manage that data, and what functionalities you may need to update that same structures. You can use pen and paper for this, also a tool like draw.io can help you a lot. It is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results.
### 2. Setting up a Node development environment
Initialize the project with `npm init`. Improve it using `express` and `nodemon`.
### 3. Creating Cloudinary account
[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) is the market leader in providing a comprehensive cloud-based image and video management platform.Follow [this link](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_integration#configuration) to configure cloudinary in your project.
### 4. Creating Models and Routes
Use `mongoose` to setup the schemas.To control the requests coming from the client, create appropriate responses: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` endpoints.
